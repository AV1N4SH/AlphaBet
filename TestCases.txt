Test Cases (Assumption is two Players, two dice each)

- Straight Challenge at Outset --> You cannot challenge at beginning of a round, Replay | Passed
- Over Challenge at the Outset --> You cannot challenge at beginning of a round, Replay | Passed
- Under Challenge at the Outset --> You cannot challenge at beginning of a round, Replay | Passed
- Calzo at the the Outset --> You cannot calzo at the beginning of a round, Replay | Passed

- Bid (0,1,1)
-- Straight Challenge --> Win if < 1 1, Lose if >= 1 1, reverse play if challenger is wrong | Passed
-- Over Challenge --> This is an invalid challenge because overunder challenge only for exact bid, Replay | Passed
-- Under Challenge --> This is an invalid challenge because overunder challenge only for exact bid, Replay | Passed
-- Calzo --> Invalid Calzo, Replay | Passed
-- Bid (0,1,1) again --> This is not a valid raise, you must raise face/quantity and never reduce quantity, Replay| Passed

Bid (1,1,1) straight
-- Straight Challenge --> Win if =/= 1 1, Lose if = 1 1, reverse play if challenger is wrong | Passed
-- Over Challenge --> This is an invalid challenge, replay | Passed
-- Under Challenge --> This is an invalid challenge, replay | Passed

- Bid (1,1,1) after (0,1,1) --> Exactly 1 1 should be submitted | Passed
-- Straight Challenge --> This is an invalid challenge, must over under | Passed
-- Over Challenge --> 
--- Win if > 1 1 | Passed
--- challenger lose AND bidder gain if = 1 1 | Passed
--- nop if < 1 1 | Passed
-- Under Challenge
--- Win if < 1 1 | Passed
--- challenger lose AND bidder gain if = 1 1 | Passed
--- nop if > 1 1 | Passed
-- Calzo
--- (all even), Challenger Block and bidder gain if = 1 1 | Passed
--- (all even),lose if =/= 1 1 | Passed
--- (other bigger hand), Challenger Block and bidder gain if = 1 1 | Passed
--- (other bigger hand),lose if =/= 1 1 | Passed
--- (Dice Leader), This is an Invalid Calzo, you are a Dice Leader | Passed
